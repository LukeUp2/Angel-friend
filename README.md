# Angel-friend

This is a game in my local church called "angel friend". 
It's a game where we draw some couples to love each other with litle things (like water, snacks...).
The goal is that the angel friend is not discovered, and only be revealed in the end of the game.

I had a task to make this raffle in a big group, so i tried to automate this :)
This is my first code public in GitHub, so please be kind ;)
